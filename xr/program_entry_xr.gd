class_name ProgramEntryXR extends Node3D

## Some parts adapted from XRTools Start XR Class
##
## This class supports both the OpenXR and WebXR interfaces, and handles
## the initialization of the interface as well as reporting when the user
## starts and ends the VR session.
##
## For OpenXR this class also supports passthrough on compatible devices such
## as the Meta Quest 1 and 2.


## This signal is emitted when XR becomes active. For OpenXR this corresponds
## with the 'openxr_focused_state' signal which occurs when the application
## starts receiving XR input, and for WebXR this corresponds with the
## 'session_started' signal.
signal xr_started

## This signal is emitted when XR ends. For OpenXR this corresponds with the
## 'openxr_visible_state' state which occurs when the application has lost
## XR input focus, and for WebXR this corresponds with the 'session_ended'
## signal.
signal xr_ended
