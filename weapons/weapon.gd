##
## Contains functionality for ammunition, magazines, fire rate (cycling), reloading, variable quantity
## of projectiles spawned at once, and duration-based continuous fire.
## [br][br]
## Use in the editor: attach script to a Node2D and configure in the Inspector panel.
## Can be set up in code but is designed to be instantiated as a scene root with [AudioStreamPlayer2D]
## children, [Marker2D] barrels (whose transform is used when spawning the projectiles), and art.
## [br][br]
##
## The various [method shoot] methods will spawn [WeaponProjectile]s at the first barrel in
## [member barrels] and continue in order for each successive shot before looping back to the first entry.
## Sound effects will play when appropriate if configured.
## Key parameters like [member accuracy_angle_spread]
## , [member power_launch_speed_mult] , [member fire_rate] , [member retain_when_empty] , and [member use_ammo]
## can completely change how the [Weapon] behaves.
## Look in [i]Behavior[/i] and [i]Ammo[/i] for details.
## The player's in-game's [b]HUD[/b] uses [member display_name] when it is called upon in
## [method Tank.push_weapon_update_to_hud].
## If configured in the Inspector, sound effects such as [member sfx_fire] will play when appropriate.
## Weapon upgrades [ModWeapon] can be attached either in the Inspector: [member weapon_mods],
## or in code using [method attach_mods].
## [br][br]
## [color=yellow]TODO[/color][i] provide support for continuous fire weapons like a laser beam etc.
