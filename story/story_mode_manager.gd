## Singleton instance that orchestrates modifying the scene tree for story mode
extends Node

## Set sthe story mode level modifiers scene
## This will be kept empty while the system is being developed
## But will be set to "res://story/story_mode_level_modifiers.tscn"
## once the weapon unlock shop at end of level is ready that can be purchased with scrap
## Later can also use scrap to purchase a random mod bundle that can upgrade existing weapons
## These will also be rewarded at the end of a story win with possibly a free choice weapon as well
## Idea is that player will have 1/3 choices for upgrade at end of a win
## 1 will be a one time mod bundle, 1 will be a weapon that can also be purchased later, and 1 will be a passive upgrade like health
## The idea is for this to be a meaningful choice with an opportunity cost associated with it as the exact mod bundle may never appear again
## Maybe we can associate a score with it like "common, uncommon, rare, and legendary"
## Player can also use scrap to refill ammo on existing weapons and a discount if refilling all ammo (as opposed to doing it for each)
## Player can refill health at a personnel discount (50%) of losing it in a loss
